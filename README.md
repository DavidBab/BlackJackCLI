This code simulates a game of blackjack directly in your console.
It simulates the cards using ASCII art. These cards are not mine, I copied them from under a stackoverflow question. 

For better experience run the game in the console. If you run it within VSCODE terminal, the screen reset might be buggy and won't show the dealers cards.
