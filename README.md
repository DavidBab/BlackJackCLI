Welcome, this code simulates a game of blackjack directly in your console.
It simulates the cards using ASCII art. These cards are not mine, I copied them from under a stackoverflow question. 

The game uses:
            - Classic Blackjack rules
            - Time imported to wait between pulling a card
            - Clear lambda function to clear your terminal
            - It can be played both on Windows and Linux

Hope you will like it.
